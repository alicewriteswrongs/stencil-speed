      "message": "fix(overlays): focus is returned to last focus element when focusing toast (#28950)\n\nIssue number: resolves #28261\n\n---------\n\n<!-- Please do not submit updates to dependencies unless it fixes an\nissue. -->\n\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type (bugfix, feature,\netc). Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nWhen moving focus from a focus-trapped overlay to a toast, focus is\nmoved back to the overlay. This is the correct behavior as focus should\nnever leave a focus-trapped overlay (unless the overlay is dismissed or\nfocus is moved to a _new_ top-most overlay). However, the way we return\nfocus is a bit unexpected because it always returns focus to the last\nfocusable element in the overlay.\n\nThis means that if you were focused on the first focusable element,\npresented the toast, and then focused the toast, focus might not be\nmoved back to that first focusable element. In the case of the linked\nissue, this was causing an unexpected scroll so that the last focused\nelement could be in view.\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\n- This fix adds an exception for `ion-toast` (as it is the only overlay\nthat is **not** focus trapped) that ensures that focus is moved back to\nthe last focus element.\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!--\n  If this introduces a breaking change:\n1. Describe the impact and migration path for existing applications\nbelow.\n  2. Update the BREAKING.md file with the breaking change.\n3. Add \"BREAKING CHANGE: [...]\" to the commit description when merging.\nSee\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#footer\nfor more information.\n-->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\n\nDev build: `7.7.1-dev.11707253408.186eea70`\n\nNote: We don't recommend this pattern in general because it would be\nimpossible for a screen reader user to focus the toast. However, we can\nat least improve the experience for developers who continue to implement\nthis pattern by returning focus in a more predictable manner.\n\nDocs: https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-docs/pull/3432\n\nTesting: \n\nReviewers should manually test the following behaviors:\n\n1. Create a modal with 2 buttons. Have one of the buttons present a\ntoast. Open the toast and verify that you can still Tab to cycle through\nthe buttons in the modal.\n2. Create a modal with 2 buttons. Have one of the buttons present a\ntoast. Open the toast. Move focus to the toast and verify that you can\nstill Tab to cycle through the buttons in the modal (once focus is\nreturned to the modal).",

This PR adds Renovatebot so it can automatically create PRs to\nupdate our GitHub Actions dependencies. I also migrated the Dependabot\nconfig to use Renovatebot so we don't have two dependency management\ntools.\n\nExample test run:\nhttps://github.com/liamdebeasi/framework-renovate-test/pulls\n\nNote: You can ignore the Docker update. I am using this fork for\nDocker-related work as well.\n\nAs a result of this PR, Renovatebot will create several PRs on this repo\nto update GitHub Actions dependencies.",

Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nIf multiple overlays are presented at the same time, none of them\nreceive `aria-hidden=\"true\"`. This means that screen readers can read\ncontents from overlays behind the current one, which can be confusing\nfor users.\n\nThe original issue also reports router outlets getting `aria-hidden`\nremoved when any overlay is dismissed, not just the last one, but we've\nsince fixed that:\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/35ab6b4816bd627239de8d8b25ce0c86db8c74b4/core/src/utils/overlays.ts#L573-L576\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\nAll overlays besides the topmost one now receive `aria-hidden=\"true\"`.\nThis means that screen readers will only announce the topmost overlay.\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!--\n  If this introduces a breaking change:\n1. Describe the impact and migration path for existing applications\nbelow.\n  2. Update the BREAKING.md file with the breaking change.\n3. Add \"BREAKING CHANGE: [...]\" to the commit description when merging.\nSee\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#footer\nfor more information.\n-->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->",

      "message": "fix(action-sheet): iOS dismiss animation respects safe area (#28915)\n\nIssue number: resolves #28541\n\n---------\n\n<!-- Please do not submit updates to dependencies unless it fixes an\nissue. -->\n\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type (bugfix, feature,\netc). Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nOn iOS when dismissing the `ion-action-sheet`, the animation does not\naccount for the safe area of the device. This results in the action\nsheet not completely animating off the visible viewport on a device with\nsafe area enabled.\n\n\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\n- The `ion-action-sheet` will animate consistently off the viewport when\ndismissing, including the safe area.\n\nTo better support custom animations not needing to account for the safe\narea, the safe area has been added to the padding of the action sheet\ncontainer. This results in the height increasing based on the bottom\nsafe area and animating correctly when translating between [`100%` and\n`0%`](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/9d57758e3ec1095c6eb951d2640b95084b711bbc/core/src/components/action-sheet/animations/ios.enter.ts#L23).\n\n\n|Before|After|\n|---|---|\n|<video\nsrc=\"https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/assets/13732623/d9475a54-f1b9-4283-ae1a-86e2b71a9d9e\"></video>|<video\nsrc=\"https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/assets/13732623/d051b4d9-4f45-4a51-b522-510f8cddef74\"></video>|\n\nIn the recorded examples the bottom safe area is exaggerated to show the\ndismiss animation differences.\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!--\n  If this introduces a breaking change:\n1. Describe the impact and migration path for existing applications\nbelow.\n  2. Update the BREAKING.md file with the breaking change.\n3. Add \"BREAKING CHANGE: [...]\" to the commit description when merging.\nSee\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#footer\nfor more information.\n-->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\nTo test this PR, I would recommend adding the following styles to the\naction sheet basic test:\n```html\n<style>\nion-action-sheet {\n  --ion-safe-area-bottom: 100px;\n}\n</style>\n```\n\n\nYou can then open dev-tools and slow the animation speed to 10%:\n\n![CleanShot 2024-01-29 at 19 49\n32@2x](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/assets/13732623/535fa663-213c-4a09-b94a-db334e4d3d29)\n\n- Open and dismiss the action sheet tied to the \"Basic\" button. \n- Verify that the action sheet animates completely off the view when\ndismissed.\n- Open the and dismiss the action sheet tied to the \"Custom CSS Class\"\nbutton. This implementation customizes the `--height` of the action\nsheet.\n- Verify that the action sheet animates completely off the view when\ndismissed.\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: ionitron <hi@ionicframework.com>\nCo-authored-by: Liam DeBeasi <liamdebeasi@users.noreply.github.com>",

Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nIn https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/pull/28861 I fixed an\nissue that caused the wrong content inside of a popover to be\nscrollable. This CSS should have been applied, but it broke back when\npopover was converted to the Shadow DOM. Fixing this issue revealed a\nmisconfiguration with the select-popover that caused the select-popover\nto no longer be scrollable.\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\n- Content inside of `ion-select-popover` can now be scrolled\n\nNote that I am considering this a bug fix instead of a regression. While\nscrolling used to work in select-popover, it only worked by chance. The\n`.popover-viewport` styles should have always applied to the\nselect-popover, thus requiring the use of `overflow-y: auto` in\nselect-popover.\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!--\n  If this introduces a breaking change:\n1. Describe the impact and migration path for existing applications\nbelow.\n  2. Update the BREAKING.md file with the breaking change.\n3. Add \"BREAKING CHANGE: [...]\" to the commit description when merging.\nSee\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#footer\nfor more information.\n-->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\nDev build: `7.7.1-dev.11706893059.1bef4b38`",

Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nThe packages, Angular, React, and Vue, will accept any `app_dir`\nparameter when passing it to the build script. This can lead to a user\nto entering a directory that doesn't exist within `test/apps`. If this\nhappens, then the build folder will include an incomplete test app.\n\nFor example:\n1. `./build ng13`\n2. This creates a `build/ng13` folder, but the folder only contains the\ncontents from the `base` folder. This causes it to be incomplete.\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\n- Provides a message that the provided app directory doesn't exist.\n- Does not create the incomplete app when an invalid app directory is\ngiven.\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!--\n  If this introduces a breaking change:\n1. Describe the impact and migration path for existing applications\nbelow.\n  4. Update the BREAKING.md file with the breaking change.\n5. Add \"BREAKING CHANGE: [...]\" to the commit description when merging.\nSee\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#footer\nfor more information.\n-->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\nN/A",

Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nThe packages, Angular, React, and Vue, will accept any `app_dir`\nparameter when passing it to the build script. This can lead to a user\nto entering a directory that doesn't exist within `test/apps`. If this\nhappens, then the build folder will include an incomplete test app.\n\nFor example:\n1. `./build ng13`\n2. This creates a `build/ng13` folder, but the folder only contains the\ncontents from the `base` folder. This causes it to be incomplete.\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\n- Provides a message that the provided app directory doesn't exist.\n- Does not create the incomplete app when an invalid app directory is\ngiven.\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!--\n  If this introduces a breaking change:\n1. Describe the impact and migration path for existing applications\nbelow.\n  4. Update the BREAKING.md file with the breaking change.\n5. Add \"BREAKING CHANGE: [...]\" to the commit description when merging.\nSee\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#footer\nfor more information.\n-->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\nN/A",

      "message": "fix(item): only default slot content wraps (#28773)\n\nIssue number: resolves #28769\n\n---------\n\n<!-- Please do not submit updates to dependencies unless it fixes an\nissue. -->\n\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type (bugfix, feature,\netc). Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nAs part of https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/pull/28146, we\nallowed text wrapping inside of `ion-item` for accessibility purposes.\nOne of the behaviors we added was to allow start, default, and end\nslotted containers to wrap to the next line to align with the iOS spec.\nHowever, this decision was based on an incorrect assumption.\n\nThe following screenshot shows the Settings app on iOS:\n\n| default scale | 310% scale |\n| - | - |\n| <img width=\"1170\" alt=\"Frame 4\"\nsrc=\"https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/assets/2721089/462ef153-a060-41c8-9a00-f0aad17839be\">\n| <img width=\"1170\" alt=\"Frame 5\"\nsrc=\"https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/assets/2721089/f047f880-7b80-4710-939b-96da075fbbf9\">\n|\n\nAt the default scale, the blue icon is in the iOS equivalent of the\n\"start\" slot, \"Bluetooth\" is in the default slot, and \"On\" is in the\n\"end\" slot. We incorrectly assumed the same markup was true when scaling\nthe text up. However, at 310% scale the icon, \"Bluetooth\" text, and \"On\"\ntext all become part of the default slot in a single container that\nwraps. You can tell because the bottom border runs underneath the blue\nicon at 310% whereas it does not at the default scale. This allows the\ntext to wrap underneath the blue icon. When we originally implemented\n#28146 we thought that this meant the start, default, and end slot\ncontainers should wrap to the next line.\n\nI further validated this behavior by creating an app with Swift UI. I\ncreated a list of items where each item has the native equivalent of a\ncheckbox in the `start` slot and multiple `ion-labels` in the default\nslot of the item:\n\n| Default Scale | 310% Scale |\n| - | - |\n|\n![IMG_3133](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/assets/2721089/8b55bd1d-f7a8-4fec-bda4-d1bb12f50d34)\n|\n![IMG_3134](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/assets/2721089/92e8a196-36e4-47d6-a4e5-a0e991c78d0d)\n|\n\nThe content within each label wraps within the container, but the\ncontainers themselves never wrap to the next line.\n\nDemo code:\n\n```swift\nimport SwiftUI\n\nstruct ContentView: View {\n    struct Item: Identifiable, Hashable {\n        let id = UUID()\n    }\n\n    private var items = [\n        Item(),\n        Item(),\n        Item(),\n        Item(),\n        Item()\n    ]\n\n    @State private var multiSelection = Set<UUID>()\n\n    var body: some View {\n        NavigationView {\n            List(items, selection: $multiSelection) {_ in\n                HStack {\n                    Text(\"Column 1 with really long text\")\n                    Text(\"Column 2 with really long text\")\n                    Text(\"Column 3 with really long text\")\n                    Text(\"Column 4 with really long text\")\n                }\n            }\n            .toolbar { EditButton() }\n        }\n        Text(\"\\(multiSelection.count) selections\")\n    }\n}\n\n#Preview {\n    ContentView()\n}\n```\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\n- This PR removes the ability for the start, default, and end slot\ncontainers to wrap to the next line. This behavior aligns with\npre-v7.6.0 behaviors. The containers inside of the default slot will not\nwrap to the next line. However, content within each container (such as\ntext within an `ion-label`) will continue to wrap to meet the team's\naccessibility requirements.\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!--\n  If this introduces a breaking change:\n1. Describe the impact and migration path for existing applications\nbelow.\n  2. Update the BREAKING.md file with the breaking change.\n3. Add \"BREAKING CHANGE: [...]\" to the commit description when merging.\nSee\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#footer\nfor more information.\n-->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\nDev build: `7.6.5-dev.11704916749.1e64a3a7`\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: ionitron <hi@ionicframework.com>",

      "message": "fix(menu): improve reliability of main content not being scrollable when menu opens (#28829)\n\nIssue number: resolves #28399\n\n---------\n\n<!-- Please do not submit updates to dependencies unless it fixes an\nissue. -->\n\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type (bugfix, feature,\netc). Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nAs part of https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/pull/26976 I\nfixed an issue where `pointer-events: none` was not applied until after\nthe menu open gesture finishes. This resolved a bug where scrolling was\nlatching after the menu gesture starts.\n\nHowever, I did not account for the edge case where scrolling latches\n_before_ `pointer-events: none` is applied in the DOM. Since scrolling\nhas already latched then `pointer-events: none` does not change the\nscrolling behavior. This can happen if a user swipes up and to the right\nfrom the left edge of the screen.\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\n- `overflow-y: hidden` is now applied to the scrollable content which\nwill interrupt any scrolling when the menu is open.\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!--\n  If this introduces a breaking change:\n1. Describe the impact and migration path for existing applications\nbelow.\n  2. Update the BREAKING.md file with the breaking change.\n3. Add \"BREAKING CHANGE: [...]\" to the commit description when merging.\nSee\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#footer\nfor more information.\n-->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\n\nTesting:\n\nThis bug fixes a timing issue where scrolling latches on the main\ncontent as the menu tries to open. As a result, I am unable to write\nreliable automated tests for this. Reviewers should perform the\nfollowing test on iOS and Android physical devices:\n\n1. Open `src/components/menu/test/basic`.\n2. Add enough elements to the main page content such that it scrolls (I\nadded a list with items).\n3. On each device, attempt to scroll the main content while also opening\nthe menu on the starting edge of the screen.\n\nScrolling on the main content should not happen if the menu opens.\n\nDev build: `7.6.5-dev.11705341148.1a550d3b`",

      "message": "fix(vue): tabs and parameterized routes work with latest vue (#28846)\n\nIssue number: resolves #28774\n\n---------\n\n<!-- Please do not submit updates to dependencies unless it fixes an\nissue. -->\n\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type (bugfix, feature,\netc). Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nThere are two issues causing Ionic Vue apps to not behave as intended\nwith certain versions of Vue:\n\n1. In Vue 3.3 a [breaking change\nshipped](https://github.com/vuejs/core/issues/9916) that changes the\ndefault behavior of the `watch` inside of IonRouterOutlet to be a\nshallow watcher instead of a deep watcher. This caused the router outlet\nto not consistent re-render. While the change was later reverted by the\nVue team, they expressed that the change [may re-land in a future minor\nrelease](https://github.com/vuejs/core/issues/9965#issuecomment-1875067499).\nAs a result, we will need to account for this inside of Ionic.\n2. In Vue 3.2 a [custom elements improvement\nshipped](https://github.com/vuejs/core/blob/main/changelogs/CHANGELOG-3.2.md#3238-2022-08-30)\nthat changed how custom elements are referred to in VNodes.\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\n- The affected `watch` call now is now explicitly a deep watcher. This\nchange is backwards compatible as well as forward compatible with\nupcoming Vue changes.\n- Updated IonTabs to account for the new VNode behavior for custom\nelements. Ionic still supports version of Vue that do not have this\nimprovement, so we need to account for both behaviors for now. I also\nadded a tech debt ticket to remove the old checks when we drop support\nfor older versions of Vue.\n- Updated E2E test dependencies. During this update some of our tests\nneeded to be updated to account for newer versions of Vue/Vitest.\nOverall I was able to simplify a lot of our tests as a result.\n\nI plan to add renovatebot to these E2E test apps, but I will handle that\nin a separate PR.\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!--\n  If this introduces a breaking change:\n1. Describe the impact and migration path for existing applications\nbelow.\n  4. Update the BREAKING.md file with the breaking change.\n5. Add \"BREAKING CHANGE: [...]\" to the commit description when merging.\nSee\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#footer\nfor more information.\n-->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\nDev build: `7.6.6-dev.11705526292.1bc0acb5`\n\nNote: Both of the issues cause tests to fail when using the latest\ndependencies in the Vue E2E test app. However, I need to use the latest\ndependencies so I can demonstrate that my changes do fix the reported\nissues. As a result, I have both fixes in the same PR.",

      "message": "fix(datetime): do not animate to new value when multiple values in different months are set (#28847)\n\nIssue number: resolves #28602\n\n---------\n\n<!-- Please do not submit updates to dependencies unless it fixes an\nissue. -->\n\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type (bugfix, feature,\netc). Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nWe animate to the new date when the value is changed, but we do not\naccount for multiple selection. This behavior is valuable for when the\nvalue is set asynchronously on a different month than what it shown.\n\nHowever, this is confusing when there are multiple dates selected in\ndifferent months, because we do not reasonably know which date to\nanimate to.\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\nDatetime no longer animates to the new value if more than one date is\nselected, and the selected dates aren't all in the same month.\n\nAn alternative strategy would be to always animate unless one of the\nselected dates is in the month currently being viewed. However, this\nwould still mean guessing at which value the user wants to see, which we\nare trying to avoid.\n\nBased on this PR:\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/pull/28605\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!--\n  If this introduces a breaking change:\n1. Describe the impact and migration path for existing applications\nbelow.\n  2. Update the BREAKING.md file with the breaking change.\n3. Add \"BREAKING CHANGE: [...]\" to the commit description when merging.\nSee\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#footer\nfor more information.\n-->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\nCo-authored-by: Liam DeBeasi <liamdebeasi@users.noreply.github.com>\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Liam DeBeasi <liamdebeasi@users.noreply.github.com>",

      "message": "fix(datetime): do not animate to new value when multiple values in different months are set (#28847)\n\nIssue number: resolves #28602\n\n---------\n\n<!-- Please do not submit updates to dependencies unless it fixes an\nissue. -->\n\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type (bugfix, feature,\netc). Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nWe animate to the new date when the value is changed, but we do not\naccount for multiple selection. This behavior is valuable for when the\nvalue is set asynchronously on a different month than what it shown.\n\nHowever, this is confusing when there are multiple dates selected in\ndifferent months, because we do not reasonably know which date to\nanimate to.\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\nDatetime no longer animates to the new value if more than one date is\nselected, and the selected dates aren't all in the same month.\n\nAn alternative strategy would be to always animate unless one of the\nselected dates is in the month currently being viewed. However, this\nwould still mean guessing at which value the user wants to see, which we\nare trying to avoid.\n\nBased on this PR:\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/pull/28605\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!--\n  If this introduces a breaking change:\n1. Describe the impact and migration path for existing applications\nbelow.\n  2. Update the BREAKING.md file with the breaking change.\n3. Add \"BREAKING CHANGE: [...]\" to the commit description when merging.\nSee\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#footer\nfor more information.\n-->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\nCo-authored-by: Liam DeBeasi <liamdebeasi@users.noreply.github.com>\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Liam DeBeasi <liamdebeasi@users.noreply.github.com>",

      "message": "fix(segment): setting value via binding updates button state (#28837)\n\nIssue number: resolves #28816\n\n---------\n\n<!-- Please do not submit updates to dependencies unless it fixes an\nissue. -->\n\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type (bugfix, feature,\netc). Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nThe value is set on Segment asynchronously when binding it in Angular.\nHowever, the timing works out such that the value changes after\n`connectedCallback` is fired but before any Stencil Watchers are\nconfigured. As a result, our `value` property watcher does not fire\nwhich causes `ionSelect` to not be emitted. Segment Buttons rely on this\nevent to know when to update their state (if the value changes such that\na segment button is now selected). This results in a checked segment\nbutton not appearing checked.\n\nThis is similar to other issues that have been fixed:\n\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/pull/28510\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/pull/28488\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/pull/28526\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\n- Segment now emits `ionSelect` on `componentDidLoad` so that any\ndescendant segment buttons can update correctly.\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!--\n  If this introduces a breaking change:\n1. Describe the impact and migration path for existing applications\nbelow.\n  2. Update the BREAKING.md file with the breaking change.\n3. Add \"BREAKING CHANGE: [...]\" to the commit description when merging.\nSee\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#footer\nfor more information.\n-->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\nDev build: `7.6.5-dev.11705415448.16878103`\n\nThis is a timing issue with Stencil, so I am unable to write a reliable\nautomated test. Reviewers should test the dev build in the repro\nprovided in the linked issue.",

      "message": "fix(segment): setting value via binding updates button state (#28837)\n\nIssue number: resolves #28816\n\n---------\n\n<!-- Please do not submit updates to dependencies unless it fixes an\nissue. -->\n\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type (bugfix, feature,\netc). Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nThe value is set on Segment asynchronously when binding it in Angular.\nHowever, the timing works out such that the value changes after\n`connectedCallback` is fired but before any Stencil Watchers are\nconfigured. As a result, our `value` property watcher does not fire\nwhich causes `ionSelect` to not be emitted. Segment Buttons rely on this\nevent to know when to update their state (if the value changes such that\na segment button is now selected). This results in a checked segment\nbutton not appearing checked.\n\nThis is similar to other issues that have been fixed:\n\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/pull/28510\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/pull/28488\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/pull/28526\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\n- Segment now emits `ionSelect` on `componentDidLoad` so that any\ndescendant segment buttons can update correctly.\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!--\n  If this introduces a breaking change:\n1. Describe the impact and migration path for existing applications\nbelow.\n  2. Update the BREAKING.md file with the breaking change.\n3. Add \"BREAKING CHANGE: [...]\" to the commit description when merging.\nSee\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#footer\nfor more information.\n-->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\nDev build: `7.6.5-dev.11705415448.16878103`\n\nThis is a timing issue with Stencil, so I am unable to write a reliable\nautomated test. Reviewers should test the dev build in the repro\nprovided in the linked issue.",

      "message": "fix(segment): setting value via binding updates button state (#28837)\n\nIssue number: resolves #28816\n\n---------\n\n<!-- Please do not submit updates to dependencies unless it fixes an\nissue. -->\n\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type (bugfix, feature,\netc). Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nThe value is set on Segment asynchronously when binding it in Angular.\nHowever, the timing works out such that the value changes after\n`connectedCallback` is fired but before any Stencil Watchers are\nconfigured. As a result, our `value` property watcher does not fire\nwhich causes `ionSelect` to not be emitted. Segment Buttons rely on this\nevent to know when to update their state (if the value changes such that\na segment button is now selected). This results in a checked segment\nbutton not appearing checked.\n\nThis is similar to other issues that have been fixed:\n\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/pull/28510\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/pull/28488\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/pull/28526\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\n- Segment now emits `ionSelect` on `componentDidLoad` so that any\ndescendant segment buttons can update correctly.\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!--\n  If this introduces a breaking change:\n1. Describe the impact and migration path for existing applications\nbelow.\n  2. Update the BREAKING.md file with the breaking change.\n3. Add \"BREAKING CHANGE: [...]\" to the commit description when merging.\nSee\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#footer\nfor more information.\n-->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\nDev build: `7.6.5-dev.11705415448.16878103`\n\nThis is a timing issue with Stencil, so I am unable to write a reliable\nautomated test. Reviewers should test the dev build in the repro\nprovided in the linked issue.",

      "message": "fix(input): slotted buttons are clickable (#28772)\n\nIssue number: resolves #28762\n\n---------\n\n<!-- Please do not submit updates to dependencies unless it fixes an\nissue. -->\n\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type (bugfix, feature,\netc). Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nFocused inputs have `pointer-events: none`. This code was added in\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/commit/e27452b789232c0a3222a03e75de1a9af19d3411\nto address https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/issues/5536.\nHowever, this causes slotted buttons to not be clickable when the input\nis focused because pointer events have been removed.\n\nThis also causes the input to blur whenever you tap the label text.\n\nThis behavior only exists on `ion-input`. Textarea is not affected.\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\nThis code was added several years ago for the (now) legacy syntax. I\ndon't have full confidence that this won't break the legacy input\nbecause there's not a lot of context around why specifically this code\nwas added. As a result, I scoped these styles only to the legacy input.\n- Slotted buttons can now be clicked when the input is focused.\n- Tapping the label when an input is focused keeps the input focused.\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!--\n  If this introduces a breaking change:\n1. Describe the impact and migration path for existing applications\nbelow.\n  2. Update the BREAKING.md file with the breaking change.\n3. Add \"BREAKING CHANGE: [...]\" to the commit description when merging.\nSee\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#footer\nfor more information.\n-->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\n**Testing:**\n\n1. I manually verified that scroll assist still works with the modern\ninput.\n2. I manually verified that the input remains focused after tapping the\nlabel.\n\nDev build: `7.6.3-dev.11704229014.12cdc767`",

      "message": "fix(input): slotted buttons are clickable (#28772)\n\nIssue number: resolves #28762\n\n---------\n\n<!-- Please do not submit updates to dependencies unless it fixes an\nissue. -->\n\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type (bugfix, feature,\netc). Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nFocused inputs have `pointer-events: none`. This code was added in\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/commit/e27452b789232c0a3222a03e75de1a9af19d3411\nto address https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/issues/5536.\nHowever, this causes slotted buttons to not be clickable when the input\nis focused because pointer events have been removed.\n\nThis also causes the input to blur whenever you tap the label text.\n\nThis behavior only exists on `ion-input`. Textarea is not affected.\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\nThis code was added several years ago for the (now) legacy syntax. I\ndon't have full confidence that this won't break the legacy input\nbecause there's not a lot of context around why specifically this code\nwas added. As a result, I scoped these styles only to the legacy input.\n- Slotted buttons can now be clicked when the input is focused.\n- Tapping the label when an input is focused keeps the input focused.\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!--\n  If this introduces a breaking change:\n1. Describe the impact and migration path for existing applications\nbelow.\n  2. Update the BREAKING.md file with the breaking change.\n3. Add \"BREAKING CHANGE: [...]\" to the commit description when merging.\nSee\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#footer\nfor more information.\n-->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\n**Testing:**\n\n1. I manually verified that scroll assist still works with the modern\ninput.\n2. I manually verified that the input remains focused after tapping the\nlabel.\n\nDev build: `7.6.3-dev.11704229014.12cdc767`",

      "message": "fix(input): slotted buttons are clickable (#28772)\n\nIssue number: resolves #28762\n\n---------\n\n<!-- Please do not submit updates to dependencies unless it fixes an\nissue. -->\n\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type (bugfix, feature,\netc). Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nFocused inputs have `pointer-events: none`. This code was added in\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/commit/e27452b789232c0a3222a03e75de1a9af19d3411\nto address https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/issues/5536.\nHowever, this causes slotted buttons to not be clickable when the input\nis focused because pointer events have been removed.\n\nThis also causes the input to blur whenever you tap the label text.\n\nThis behavior only exists on `ion-input`. Textarea is not affected.\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\nThis code was added several years ago for the (now) legacy syntax. I\ndon't have full confidence that this won't break the legacy input\nbecause there's not a lot of context around why specifically this code\nwas added. As a result, I scoped these styles only to the legacy input.\n- Slotted buttons can now be clicked when the input is focused.\n- Tapping the label when an input is focused keeps the input focused.\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!--\n  If this introduces a breaking change:\n1. Describe the impact and migration path for existing applications\nbelow.\n  2. Update the BREAKING.md file with the breaking change.\n3. Add \"BREAKING CHANGE: [...]\" to the commit description when merging.\nSee\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#footer\nfor more information.\n-->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\n**Testing:**\n\n1. I manually verified that scroll assist still works with the modern\ninput.\n2. I manually verified that the input remains focused after tapping the\nlabel.\n\nDev build: `7.6.3-dev.11704229014.12cdc767`",

      "message": "fix(radio-group): radio disabled prop can be undefined (#28712)\n\nIssue number: resolves #28677\n\n---------\n\n<!-- Please do not submit updates to dependencies unless it fixes an\nissue. -->\n\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type (bugfix, feature,\netc). Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nDefining disabled a `@Prop() disabled = false` causes Stencil to mark\nthis property as optional. This behavior is not desired on our end, but\nmaking the property required would be a breaking change. Additionally,\nthe root issue is due to how Stencil resolves types.\n\nFor example, `disabled` is [optional in the LocalJSX\nnamespace](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/e96a1457a32646fa23c8218cb3cca4a8215ad115/core/src/components.d.ts#L6921)\nbut [required in the Components\nnamespace](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/e96a1457a32646fa23c8218cb3cca4a8215ad115/core/src/components.d.ts#L2239).\nAddressing this inside of Stencil is significant breaking change. As a\nresult, the team has decided to compromise and support the falsy\n`disabled` state for radio for now. Other Ionic components that support\nthe `disabled` prop also check for falsy values.\n\nStencil plans to de-risk this in\nhttps://ionic-cloud.atlassian.net/browse/STENCIL-917.\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\n- Radio Group now looks at falsy values instead of strictly checking\n`false`.\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!--\n  If this introduces a breaking change:\n1. Describe the impact and migration path for existing applications\nbelow.\n  2. Update the BREAKING.md file with the breaking change.\n3. Add \"BREAKING CHANGE: [...]\" to the commit description when merging.\nSee\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#footer\nfor more information.\n-->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\n\nDev build: `7.6.2-dev.11703182244.1165aeec`",

      "message": "fix(radio-group): radio disabled prop can be undefined (#28712)\n\nIssue number: resolves #28677\n\n---------\n\n<!-- Please do not submit updates to dependencies unless it fixes an\nissue. -->\n\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type (bugfix, feature,\netc). Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nDefining disabled a `@Prop() disabled = false` causes Stencil to mark\nthis property as optional. This behavior is not desired on our end, but\nmaking the property required would be a breaking change. Additionally,\nthe root issue is due to how Stencil resolves types.\n\nFor example, `disabled` is [optional in the LocalJSX\nnamespace](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/e96a1457a32646fa23c8218cb3cca4a8215ad115/core/src/components.d.ts#L6921)\nbut [required in the Components\nnamespace](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/e96a1457a32646fa23c8218cb3cca4a8215ad115/core/src/components.d.ts#L2239).\nAddressing this inside of Stencil is significant breaking change. As a\nresult, the team has decided to compromise and support the falsy\n`disabled` state for radio for now. Other Ionic components that support\nthe `disabled` prop also check for falsy values.\n\nStencil plans to de-risk this in\nhttps://ionic-cloud.atlassian.net/browse/STENCIL-917.\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\n- Radio Group now looks at falsy values instead of strictly checking\n`false`.\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!--\n  If this introduces a breaking change:\n1. Describe the impact and migration path for existing applications\nbelow.\n  2. Update the BREAKING.md file with the breaking change.\n3. Add \"BREAKING CHANGE: [...]\" to the commit description when merging.\nSee\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#footer\nfor more information.\n-->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\n\nDev build: `7.6.2-dev.11703182244.1165aeec`",

      "message": "fix(radio-group): radio disabled prop can be undefined (#28712)\n\nIssue number: resolves #28677\n\n---------\n\n<!-- Please do not submit updates to dependencies unless it fixes an\nissue. -->\n\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type (bugfix, feature,\netc). Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nDefining disabled a `@Prop() disabled = false` causes Stencil to mark\nthis property as optional. This behavior is not desired on our end, but\nmaking the property required would be a breaking change. Additionally,\nthe root issue is due to how Stencil resolves types.\n\nFor example, `disabled` is [optional in the LocalJSX\nnamespace](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/e96a1457a32646fa23c8218cb3cca4a8215ad115/core/src/components.d.ts#L6921)\nbut [required in the Components\nnamespace](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/e96a1457a32646fa23c8218cb3cca4a8215ad115/core/src/components.d.ts#L2239).\nAddressing this inside of Stencil is significant breaking change. As a\nresult, the team has decided to compromise and support the falsy\n`disabled` state for radio for now. Other Ionic components that support\nthe `disabled` prop also check for falsy values.\n\nStencil plans to de-risk this in\nhttps://ionic-cloud.atlassian.net/browse/STENCIL-917.\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\n- Radio Group now looks at falsy values instead of strictly checking\n`false`.\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!--\n  If this introduces a breaking change:\n1. Describe the impact and migration path for existing applications\nbelow.\n  2. Update the BREAKING.md file with the breaking change.\n3. Add \"BREAKING CHANGE: [...]\" to the commit description when merging.\nSee\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#footer\nfor more information.\n-->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\n\nDev build: `7.6.2-dev.11703182244.1165aeec`",

      "message": "fix(radio-group): radio disabled prop can be undefined (#28712)\n\nIssue number: resolves #28677\n\n---------\n\n<!-- Please do not submit updates to dependencies unless it fixes an\nissue. -->\n\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type (bugfix, feature,\netc). Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nDefining disabled a `@Prop() disabled = false` causes Stencil to mark\nthis property as optional. This behavior is not desired on our end, but\nmaking the property required would be a breaking change. Additionally,\nthe root issue is due to how Stencil resolves types.\n\nFor example, `disabled` is [optional in the LocalJSX\nnamespace](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/e96a1457a32646fa23c8218cb3cca4a8215ad115/core/src/components.d.ts#L6921)\nbut [required in the Components\nnamespace](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/e96a1457a32646fa23c8218cb3cca4a8215ad115/core/src/components.d.ts#L2239).\nAddressing this inside of Stencil is significant breaking change. As a\nresult, the team has decided to compromise and support the falsy\n`disabled` state for radio for now. Other Ionic components that support\nthe `disabled` prop also check for falsy values.\n\nStencil plans to de-risk this in\nhttps://ionic-cloud.atlassian.net/browse/STENCIL-917.\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\n- Radio Group now looks at falsy values instead of strictly checking\n`false`.\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!--\n  If this introduces a breaking change:\n1. Describe the impact and migration path for existing applications\nbelow.\n  2. Update the BREAKING.md file with the breaking change.\n3. Add \"BREAKING CHANGE: [...]\" to the commit description when merging.\nSee\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#footer\nfor more information.\n-->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\n\nDev build: `7.6.2-dev.11703182244.1165aeec`",

Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nIn https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/issues/28694 there was\nsome confusion around how to access `this` inside of a callback function\npassed to a property on Ionic components. The root issue was due to how\nthe `this` context is determined with developers being responsible for\nsetting the appropriate `this` context.\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\n- While this isn't an Ionic bug, I think it's worth calling out this\nbehavior so developers are aware of how to account for it.\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!--\n  If this introduces a breaking change:\n1. Describe the impact and migration path for existing applications\nbelow.\n  2. Update the BREAKING.md file with the breaking change.\n3. Add \"BREAKING CHANGE: [...]\" to the commit description when merging.\nSee\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/blob/main/.github/CONTRIBUTING.md#footer\nfor more information.\n-->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\n\nNote: The link in the docs will not work until\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-docs/pull/3333 is merged.\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: Amanda Johnston <90629384+amandaejohnston@users.noreply.github.com>",

      "message": "fix(input, textarea, select): reduce padding on slotted buttons (#28676)\n\nIssue number: N/A\n\n---------\n\n<!-- Please do not submit updates to dependencies unless it fixes an\nissue. -->\n\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type (bugfix, feature,\netc). Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nButtons slotted in the start/end slots of input, textarea, or select\nhave a lot of excess padding that can cause them to look misaligned from\nother pieces such as the control's label, especially when using\n`fill=\"clear\"`.\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\nPadding removed, and a border radius added so that non-clear buttons as\nwell as the focus state on clear buttons still look okay. Existing\nscreenshot tests have also been updated to include buttons (non-clear\nones so you can see the border radius in the screenshots).\n\nLet me know if you think this should go on a feature branch instead. I\nchose `main` because the current experience looks somewhat broken and we\njust did a minor release recently, but this could be considered a\nnotable enough behavior change.\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!-- If this introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact\nand migration path for existing applications below. -->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: ionitron <hi@ionicframework.com>",

      "message": "fix(input, textarea, select): reduce padding on slotted buttons (#28676)\n\nIssue number: N/A\n\n---------\n\n<!-- Please do not submit updates to dependencies unless it fixes an\nissue. -->\n\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type (bugfix, feature,\netc). Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nButtons slotted in the start/end slots of input, textarea, or select\nhave a lot of excess padding that can cause them to look misaligned from\nother pieces such as the control's label, especially when using\n`fill=\"clear\"`.\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\nPadding removed, and a border radius added so that non-clear buttons as\nwell as the focus state on clear buttons still look okay. Existing\nscreenshot tests have also been updated to include buttons (non-clear\nones so you can see the border radius in the screenshots).\n\nLet me know if you think this should go on a feature branch instead. I\nchose `main` because the current experience looks somewhat broken and we\njust did a minor release recently, but this could be considered a\nnotable enough behavior change.\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!-- If this introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact\nand migration path for existing applications below. -->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: ionitron <hi@ionicframework.com>",

      "message": "fix(input, textarea, select): reduce padding on slotted buttons (#28676)\n\nIssue number: N/A\n\n---------\n\n<!-- Please do not submit updates to dependencies unless it fixes an\nissue. -->\n\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type (bugfix, feature,\netc). Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nButtons slotted in the start/end slots of input, textarea, or select\nhave a lot of excess padding that can cause them to look misaligned from\nother pieces such as the control's label, especially when using\n`fill=\"clear\"`.\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\nPadding removed, and a border radius added so that non-clear buttons as\nwell as the focus state on clear buttons still look okay. Existing\nscreenshot tests have also been updated to include buttons (non-clear\nones so you can see the border radius in the screenshots).\n\nLet me know if you think this should go on a feature branch instead. I\nchose `main` because the current experience looks somewhat broken and we\njust did a minor release recently, but this could be considered a\nnotable enough behavior change.\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!-- If this introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact\nand migration path for existing applications below. -->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\n---------\n\nCo-authored-by: ionitron <hi@ionicframework.com>",

      "message": "fix(react): router creates new view instances of parameterized routes (#28616)\n\nIssue number: Resolves #26524 \n\n---------\n\n<!-- Please do not submit updates to dependencies unless it fixes an\nissue. -->\n\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type (bugfix, feature,\netc). Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## Definitions\n\n**Parameterized routes**: A route that includes one or more variables in\nthe path segments, such as `/form/:index`.\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nWhen an application routes from a parameterized route, to an\nintermediary route, to the same parameterized route, but with a\ndifferent value/url, Ionic's routing logic is incorrectly reusing the\nview item from the first instance of the parameterized route instead of\ncalculating that the matched path is different. This results in the\nwrong view item being recycled and rendered.\n\nAnother way of representing it:\n- User navigates to `/form/0` which resolves `FormPage`\n- User enters `0` into the form and submits the form\n- User navigates to `/link`, which resolves `LinkPage`\n- User navigates to `/form/1`, which resolves `FormPage`\n- However, instead of creating a new instance of `FormPage` it is\nreusing the instance of `FormPage` from `/form/0` which includes the\nform having `0` in the input.\n  - The user now sees a \"new view\", but with cached data in the form.\n\nThis is not expected or desired. \n\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\n- Ionic's routing logic will validate if the entering view item matches\nthe match route data before reusing it. This results in new instances of\nthe view item being constructed when using parameterized routes.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/assets/13732623/e7e3d03f-2848-4429-9f60-9074d0761e45\n\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!-- If this introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact\nand migration path for existing applications below. -->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\nDev-build: `7.5.8-dev.11701383555.17254408`",

      "message": "fix(react): router creates new view instances of parameterized routes (#28616)\n\nIssue number: Resolves #26524 \n\n---------\n\n<!-- Please do not submit updates to dependencies unless it fixes an\nissue. -->\n\n<!-- Please try to limit your pull request to one type (bugfix, feature,\netc). Submit multiple pull requests if needed. -->\n\n## Definitions\n\n**Parameterized routes**: A route that includes one or more variables in\nthe path segments, such as `/form/:index`.\n\n## What is the current behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the current behavior that you are modifying. -->\n\nWhen an application routes from a parameterized route, to an\nintermediary route, to the same parameterized route, but with a\ndifferent value/url, Ionic's routing logic is incorrectly reusing the\nview item from the first instance of the parameterized route instead of\ncalculating that the matched path is different. This results in the\nwrong view item being recycled and rendered.\n\nAnother way of representing it:\n- User navigates to `/form/0` which resolves `FormPage`\n- User enters `0` into the form and submits the form\n- User navigates to `/link`, which resolves `LinkPage`\n- User navigates to `/form/1`, which resolves `FormPage`\n- However, instead of creating a new instance of `FormPage` it is\nreusing the instance of `FormPage` from `/form/0` which includes the\nform having `0` in the input.\n  - The user now sees a \"new view\", but with cached data in the form.\n\nThis is not expected or desired. \n\n\n## What is the new behavior?\n<!-- Please describe the behavior or changes that are being added by\nthis PR. -->\n\n- Ionic's routing logic will validate if the entering view item matches\nthe match route data before reusing it. This results in new instances of\nthe view item being constructed when using parameterized routes.\n\n\nhttps://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-framework/assets/13732623/e7e3d03f-2848-4429-9f60-9074d0761e45\n\n\n## Does this introduce a breaking change?\n\n- [ ] Yes\n- [x] No\n\n<!-- If this introduces a breaking change, please describe the impact\nand migration path for existing applications below. -->\n\n\n## Other information\n\n<!-- Any other information that is important to this PR such as\nscreenshots of how the component looks before and after the change. -->\n\nDev-build: `7.5.8-dev.11701383555.17254408`",
